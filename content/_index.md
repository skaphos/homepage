Skaphos is an operational control system for Kubernetes infrastructure.

We build focused, Kubernetes-native tools for platform teams that need deliberate control of infrastructure operations. Rather than abstracting Kubernetes away, our tooling keeps platform state explicit, verifiable, and predictable.

## Operating principles

- Explicit state over implicit behavior.
- Deterministic operation and reconstructible systems.
- Composable tools with focused operational responsibilities.
- Kubernetes-native architecture compatible with GitOps workflows.
