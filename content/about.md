title: "About"
---

Skaphos exists to reduce operational ambiguity for platform teams running Kubernetes at scale.

Our mission is to help engineers operate infrastructure with clarity, control, and predictability. We start with practical operational tools and evolve toward a cohesive system over time.

## What Skaphos is not

- Not a platform-as-a-service abstraction.
- Not a proprietary orchestration layer that replaces Kubernetes.

## Audience

Skaphos is built for platform engineers, infrastructure engineers, and Kubernetes operators working in real production environments.
